AWS Cloud Formation:

AWS Cloud Formation provides users with a simple way to create and manage a collection of AWS resources by provisioning and updating them in an orderly and predictable way.

AWS Cloud Formation enables you to manage your complete infrastructure or AWS resources through a text file.

All the resources required by a user in an application can be deployed easily using templates.
Also, you can reuse your templates to replicate your infrastructure in multiple environments.
To make templates reusable, use the parameters, mapping and conditions sections in the templates so that you can customize your stacks when you create them.

How AWS Cloud Formation work?
1. Create or use existing CloudFormation template using JSON/YAML format
2. Save your code template locally or in S3 Bucket.
3. Use AWS CloudFormation to create  a stack on your template. 
4. AWS CloudFormation constructs and configures your stack resources that you have specified in your template.

Template:
A template in AWS CloudFormation is a formatted text file in JSON or YAML language that describe your AWS infrastructure.
To create, view and modify templates you can use AWS CloudFormation Designer or any text editor tool.
Template in Amazon CloudFormation consits of 9 main objects.
1) Format Version, 2) Description, 3) Metadata, 4) Parameters, 5) Mappings, 6) Conditions, 7) Transform, 8) Resources & 9) Outputs.

Stack:
A collection of AWS Resources is called a stack and it can be managed in a single unit.
CloudFormation's template defines a stack in which the resources can be created, deleted or updated in a predictable way.
A stack can have all the resources (web servers, database etc.) that can be required to run a web application.

Windows Stack:
Windows Stack gives you the ability to update and configure your own stack in windows instances.
with AWS CloudFormation, you can create Microsoft windows stack for amazon EC2 windows AMI(Amazon Machine Images).

StackSets:
Using an AWS CloudFormation template, you can define a stackset that lets you to create stacks in AWS accounts across the globe by using a single template.
After a stack set is defined by you, creating, updating or deleting stacks in the target accounts and regions can also be specified.

CloudFormation Access Control:
IAM User Access: with IAM, CloudFormation can have access control for users and ensure that only IAM users can create, update and delete stacks.
Service Role: on the user's behalf, a service role allows AWS CloudFormation to make calls to resources in a stack.
StackPolicy: It is applied to all AWS CloudFormation users who attempt to update the stack. Here, you cannot include diffeent users with different stack policies.
